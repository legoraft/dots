# Usage

These dotfiles aren't paticularly built to be used, but if you'd really want to, this is a guide on using them correctly and making sure everything works. This repository is set up to be used with `stow`. This program creates symlinks between directories in this repository and the `$HOME` directory.

### Using stow

To use a certain module in this repository, you can activate it using the `stow <module>` command in the directory of this repository. This is the preferred way of using this repository, as it enables you to make changes and push them to the remote.

### Dependencies

Every module in these dotfiles require some dependencies. The window managers require the most dependencies, but all other configs require not that many dependencies.
